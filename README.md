# File Organizer Script

The **File Organizer Script** is a Python script I developed to automate the organization of files in a specified directory. The script sorts files based on their extensions into designated folders, improving file management and accessibility. Additionally, it removes empty folders, enhancing the overall cleanliness of the file structure.

### Key Features:

- Automatically categorizes files into appropriate folders based on their extensions (documents, images, videos, audios, archives, executables, others).
- Utilizes Python's `os` and `shutil` libraries for file manipulation and organization.
- Removes empty folders recursively, improving folder structure and system efficiency.

### Technical Details:

- Developed using Python, leveraging the `os` and `shutil` modules for file operations.
- Implements a structured approach to folder creation and file sorting, enhancing maintainability.
- Utilizes conditional statements to determine file types and extensions for accurate organization.

This project showcases my skills in Python scripting, file manipulation, and organization. By automating the task of file organization, I aimed to enhance productivity and maintain a well-structured file system.
